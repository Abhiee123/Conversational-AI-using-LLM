## 🧩 **Project Overview**

This project integrates **speech recognition**, **image analysis**, and **text-to-speech** technologies to build an intelligent AI assistant that acts like a doctor.  
The user can **speak their symptoms**, **upload a medical image**, and receive a **spoken diagnosis** — all through a single interface.

By combining **Groq’s Whisper & LLaMA Vision models**, **Google Text-to-Speech**, and **Gradio**, this project demonstrates a practical use of **multimodal AI** in healthcare simulation.
